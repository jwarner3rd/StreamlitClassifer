Mushroom Classification Dashboard
Overview
The Mushroom Classification Dashboard is a Streamlit-based web application designed to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their characteristics. The app uses three machine learning algorithms for binary classification:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Users can select a classifier, tune hyperparameters, and view evaluation metrics such as:

Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve
Precision-Recall Curve
Features
Dataset Preprocessing: Encodes categorical features using Label Encoding.
Interactive Model Training: Allows users to tune hyperparameters and train models in real-time.
Visualization: Displays key evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Documentation: Offers built-in explanations for each machine learning algorithm.
